# MUSTARD
The R package **MUSTARD** (**MU**lti-**S**ample **T**rajectory-**A**ssisted **R**eduction of **D**imensions) performs a trajectory-guided method for the dimension reduction of multi-sample scRNA-seq data. This all-in-one decomposition reveals major gene expression variation patterns along the trajectory and across multiple samples simultaneously, providing opportunities to discover sample endotypes and associated genes.
